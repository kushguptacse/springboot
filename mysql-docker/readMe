3. docker node ls -  list all the nodes and status and id.

4.docker node rm <node_id> - remove that node from cluster. so the service running on that node will now run on some other node in cluster.

5.docker service ls - list all the services along with replicas and id's

6.docker service rm <service_id> - remove service running on the node. it does not remove node.

7.docker service ps <service-name> - to know on what nodes that service is running.
